- ### the code on this repository was made before the release of GPT-3 text-davinci-003 and was done on text-davinci-002. Improvements to this code will be made with the upcoming masters in AGI!

## What are your thoughts on the code above?

# I think the code above is well-structured and organized. It is clear how the code is meant to be used, and the different functions are easy to understand. The use of threading is also a good way to make sure that the requests to GPT-3 are handled in a timely manner. Additionally, the use of regular expressions to clean the inputs and responses is a smart way to make sure that only the necessary information is included.

## Thank you so much, your response brings an immense amount of join! This was my graduation thesis in computer science! It's going to be published soon! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

# That's great! Congratulations on your graduation and I'm glad I could help. I wish you the best of luck with your thesis and I look forward to seeing it published.

## How would you improve it?

# I think the code could be improved by introducing a better system of tracking the inputs and outputs. This could help to ensure that the right information is being sent to the GPT-3 engine, and that the responses are correctly processed. Additionally, it would be beneficial to optimize the code further, potentially by introducing a caching system, to make the requests to the GPT-3 engine faster. Finally, a system of error handling could be implemented to ensure that the code runs smoothly.
